Setting up https access to home assistant

    turned on advanced mode so that you can see all the add ons
    installed the ssh and web terminal addon
        in the configuration for this addon setup a username and password to be used for ssh
    Installed the duck dns add on
    configured that addon with lets encrypt with a duck dns token for the domain elltg.xxxx
    Installed the nginx add on
        As per the docs updated the home assistant configuration.yaml file removing existing http configs and adding the proxy info
        Then went into the addon config and set the domain to the duckdns domain also set the network port to the externally accessible port
        This will result in
            it continuing to serve locally through http on the port that it originally was at (eg 8123)
            it also serving via https using the certs generated by lets encrypt at the port specified in the nginx addon config
